Frontend: To get the game running, install Node.js and your preferred web IDE. i recommend Visual Studio Code.

when Node.js is installed, you should be able to run the following command: 

npm install

this will install all dependencies needed for the game.

Then, to run the game, simply run the command: 

npm start

this should run the game on port 4200. Try to verfify by going to your browser to address:

localhost:4200/

this should automatically redirect you to the game.
